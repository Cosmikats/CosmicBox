CosmicBox
=========

Our CosmicBox is a fork of Jason Griffey's LibraryBox http://jasongriffey.net/librarybox

The script install_bibliobox.sh has been written by Mathieu Soula in order to set up a LibraryBox on a RaspberryPi.

The Specs of the devices used and a few other set up tips can be found (in French) on http://cosmicbox.leschatscosmiques.net
